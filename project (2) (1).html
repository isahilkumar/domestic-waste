    <h3 >Domestic solid waste, commonly known as trash or garbage (US), refuse or rubbish(UK) is a waste type consisting of everyday items that are discarded by the public. The organic waste potions consist of food and kitchen waste, yard trimmings or other garden waste. Inorganic waste  consists of paper, corrugated cardboard, plastic, glass, wood, and metal products such as drink cans.

        In this unit we will look at your contribution to domestic waste as well as the waste contributed by our community. We will also look at different management strategies in dealing with domestic waste</h3>

    <h2>Domestic-waste recycling methods:</h2>
    <h3>The modern sanitary landfill is much more than a simple dumping ground, due to the fact that waste materials are handled in a more controlled fashion to preserve the quality of groundwater in the area. Lighter materials are placed at the bottom of the sanitary landfill, which contains the majority of toxic compounds, thereby protecting the local environment. According to the University of Michigan's website, after each day's new waste is added, a new layer of soil is added to cover the waste in the hopes that it will break down before the landfill's barrier between the waste and the groundwater breaks down. Sanitary landfills require continuous maintenance and treatment of wastewater as well as the recovery of toxic gases, making them potentially hazardous if left derelict long enough to allow systems to fail. The main flaw of the sanitary landfill concept is that it continually consumes both land and resources to contain the waste, in addition to being potentially ecologically damaging. Landfills could also stifle the growth of a city, due to the fact that they are usually constructed at present city limits without accounting for potential growth and land-use needs. No one is going to want to buy property on or near a landfill, making the landfill itself and the surrounding area a proverbial no man's land.</h3>
